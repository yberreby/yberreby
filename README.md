### Hey, I'm Yoha√Ø-Eliel BERREBY üëã

I'm currently a PhD student at the [M2B3 lab](https://m2b3.github.io/) at McGill, in the Department of Physiology. I am also a member of Mila, co-supervised by Prof. Audrey Durand (U. Laval). Before starting my PhD, I was a Backend Software Engineer at [Routine](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/routine) (YC W21), mainly programming in OCaml.

My research is focused on the intersection of AI neuroscience. How can the brain teach us to build better AI, and how can we use AI to understand the brain better?

In no particular order and in a totally non-comprehensive fashion, I love playing around with:
- Very-low-level, high-performance programming
- Functional programming
- Compilers
- The power of interactive visualization as an educational tool

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yberreby/) and [Mastodon](https://masto.ai/@yberreby).
